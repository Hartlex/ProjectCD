50101	The first road leading to the capital city, Etherain.#Since the Imperial Army occupied the peaceful and beautiful forest, it has started emitting a dark and damp energy,#and for anyone who enters, #it becomes the forest of death.
50102	It has been told that the beast riders of the Dark Order, #well adapted to this wild forest, exist here. #Forest of Beasts has been known to swallow all living things.
50103	However, you must pass through this forest#to go to Etherain.

50105	Violent temper of the battle field brought fourth dark and damp underground air#luring evil energy.#This presence keeps the dead from their eternal rest and sleep.
50106	Place for the undead who lost humanity and have only an aggressive temper and strength.#in order to punish the master of Etherain, who is a mere servant of Schwartz.# This place must be passed through as quickly as possible.
50107	The castle was situated among the mountain ridges above a pure white Snowy Plains. #It was a location where people had been reluctant to enter because of the harsh terrain and severe cold.#However, it was also a place beauty with glowing snow and ice.
50108	However, the evil forces of the Black Demon have penetrated this place# and turned the innocent chill into a deadly coldness that #snatches everything away from all beings without mercy.
50109	A world where time seems to have stopped.#Under neath the cold ice, where living creatures, sleeping refrained from breathing lay, #await for a hero who will bring time back to this world once again.#
50110	A place of exile, where the Dragonkins were restrained by black magic.#They were expelled to a lava plateau in the remote region with their power sealed by the Demons#who were jealous and feared the Dragonkin's power.
50111	"Hotter than lava, hatred and vengance#boil in their hearts.#Even after losing the power of dragons, this is the home town of knights with still a strong sense of pride."
50112	They will surely lend their help to people #who keep the promise to help them regain their lost power.
50113	A fertile soil blessed by the God of Wind and Goddess of Earth.#But, after the benevolent and clever monarch fell into evil doctrines ,#God's blessing departed this land.
50114	Now, the land of heretics who admire destruction and death, #it will be hard to see the glory of the past again.#The Lord of Castle who posseses the heart of Ether and#owes their resurection to the Emperor, #devastated this land with more evil forces.
50115	In order to recover the fertile land,#the one who caused the destruction must be defeated.
50116	Rumanka, a faithful subject of the Emperor and her clan, Helron's Castle. #Rumanka, who had the heart of Ether transplanted from the Emperor,#established a huge Ether plant here and#exercised strong power over the Demons.
50117	In Helron's Castle, there have been studies #to strengthen their power using the Ether.
50118	In order to assure the breakdown of the Empire spirit,#you should consider this place, the sanctuary and fortress of Helrons, #to be your strategic priority.
50201	Deep forest with thick trees.#Elite soldiers of the Dark Order of Imperial Army keep this place.#The first battle field for the rebel army to enter Etherain.
50202	Souls roaming in the dark sewer for a long time#were resurrected as the undead by the power of Ether.#They seized the sewer and prey on human life.
50203	Beautiful frozen palace#where severe chill and cold is felt to the bone.#You must get rid of the king who has become a slave of Ether in this palace. 
50204	"Steep in the infertile valley of volcano, there is only dreadfully boiling lava.#The Drake Knights who have betrayed the Dragons,# block the road to freedom of the rebel army."

160101	Krrrr...
160102	I am cursed with the pain of life after death! You shall suffer the same fate as well!
160103	You do not know what true pain is like. Let me show you!  
160104	I will destroy them all! I will kill every living being! Every single one of them!! 
160105	You deserve whatever pain I give you! 
160106	I will release you from your worthless existence!
160108	I have awaited this moment for such a long time. May my eyes never open again.
160201	Glory to the emperor who has granted me my magic! 
160202	I hate all living creatures! I'll never forgive those wretched humans who betrayed me.
160203	Cursed Mana and horrid Ether. I cannot break the chain of this curse put upon me.
160206	You ungrateful humans! I shall not spare your lives! 
160208	Artrum Tempestas!
160209	My power will destroy you!
160210	I will shatter your betraying heart into bits! 
160303	Everlasting life! Eternal King! I am the God! 
160304	Strange, white objects are appearing before my old eyes.  It is as if ice forms on them. Bring me the royal physician!
160305	You disrespect me, peasant! Leave my Kingdom now! 
160306	You dare to come to see me in person without permission. Flog that rude insect!
160308	My hall is getting dirty! These filthy bastards are treading on my hall!
160311	Only death can be given to those rude men who think lightly of the king!
160401	The Empire shall never pass through this land! 
160402	"On the honor of Siegel Knights, I will not let you pass!"
160404	"The Empire is an enemy of the Continent! There would never, ever be any conclusion of agreements between us!"
160405	Here goes sacred Bios' Sword attack! 
160406	You will pay for what you owe to the Empire! 
160407	Thank you for setting me free from a long dream...
160408	...Thank you.
170101	Ah! The forces of black Ether hanging over the forest bring me joy.
170102	There you are! I will get your soul and dedicate it to my master! 
170103	You voluntarily come to your burial place. 
170104	Your fear makes me pleasant! Come on! 
170105	My curse shall penetrate deep into the marrow of your bones!
170106	Witness the power vested in me by the master! 
170107	"Very well, I can kill you now."
170108	The power of Ether will raise me up again!
170109	"Although you have defeated me, the fact that the Empire is strong will never change."
170110	Someday...you will pay by rising in revolt against the Empire...
170201	"Come on, this way, companions of death."
170202	Huh! The living has come to this place. It is always worth trying to acquire the spirit of strong ones.  
170205	"Speak to me your name, Oh! You the living, I  commend your bravery for coming to the land of the dead."
170206	"Don't worry, if you die, I will raise you from the dead and let you enjoy everlasting life with your friends here."
170208	Be a part of darkness! 
170209	"Now, come into our world."
170210	"It is a really  life  invoking, the desire to acquire. I must possess it by all means!"
170211	"I am telling you, the living, in the physical body that experienced death once, there is no eternal death in that body any longer."
170212	"The living fears death that occurs once; however, we don't even dread death several times."
170213	"You the living, I am sending you a song of praise for your strength. I will surely see the path you follow."
170301	I don't care whether my enemy is human or the Empire. You should bear in your mind that we are characters who guard Lucious! 
170302	You people are the life raised by Lucious. I want you to remember that fact. 
170304	"My Sword is the will of Lucious, and I will compensate for his fate by taking your life!"
170305	You the living! Here goes the sword that will bring you death!
170306	You shall never come near Lucious! 
170307	"Even with my physical body of only bones, I will attack you to protect Lucious!"
170308	"As long as Lucious exists, I'll protect him from all dangers."
170309	"Actual death means nothing to me. Even though you have defeated me, you will not truly be regarded a winner."
170310	"Lucious, please forgive the mistake made by this servant."
170401	Even the carless rebel forces would not come into this cold place.
170402	"Like the weak rebel forces coming into this place, they would be turned into ice statues right away."
170403	"You people are admirable, for you have come this far. However, this will be your end!"
170404	"Even if you run away, I can find you anywhere!"
170405	I will turn you into an ice statue.
170406	Look how weak and frail your physical bodies are!
170407	"Having an insect-like appearance, you are better than expected! From now on, do not expect any favors from me!"
170408	How can I be defeated by such insects... 
170409	"You are admirable, for you have knocked me down. But do not ever think that you can defeat the Lord of Castle as well."
180101	Look carefully to see if anybody is coming! The chief will not tolerate failure!
180103	"It looks like there is something over there. Quick, look!"
180105	Don't enter! This forest is ours!!! 
180106	Enemies! Attack!!
180107	"I am strong, STRONG I Say!"
180109	The energy of the Forest is with me.
180110	"Hmm, even if I lose, nothing will change. You will never defeat the chief."
180112	I am hurt.
180201	Those rebel force rats can easily sneak into any place. Keep an eye on every nook and cranny. 
180202	"If we keep this place safe, the master will reward us."
180203	The master ordered us to kill all who trespass this forest. Kill them!
180204	"There you are. Somehow, I have smelled a skunk!"
180206	Watch the power the master has given us!
180207	For the glory of the master!
180208	"In all events, you cannot beat the Empire."
180209	Oh! my master...
180303	"Worthless human, weak! I'm big and strong!"
180304	Battle! 
180305	I protect this place. I will kill you! 
180307	Take this!
180308	Muh-hahahaha! 
180309	I will break it down!! 
180401	Hum...I can smell the scent emitting from the living. 
180402	I really hate the Dragonkin! They make stink of their own.
180403	I am hungry. 
180404	Kihihihi...hihi!
180405	Kyahaha! Humans!
180406	Come on! Be with us! 
180407	You just keep quiet. Just surrender to me!
180408	Go on dance with your fury! But it does not work!
180409	Keuk Keuk K hahaha..
180410	"I will remember you. Next time, you will be the first.."
180501	What a miserable fate that I have become a slave of the Empire. There could be no other shameful incident than this.
180502	I am a warrior of the Ice Dragons. What on earth am I here for. I wish I could recover my strength.
180504	Don't blame me. I am now a slave of the Empire!
180505	"If I lose you, I cannot keep my life any longer. I need to be alive in order to do more things whatever they are. I will not let you go."
180507	You watch the power of the Ice Dragons!
180508	Take this!
180509	I will admit my defeat.
180510	You people seem to be able to defeat the Empire. I wish our liberation would come true sooner.
180511	The Lord of Castle is protected by Ether Stone. You'd better be careful..
180601	Feels like I'm having a long dream.
180602	I wonder where those bastards from the Empire have come. 
180605	"Come on, you Empire bastards!"
180606	I am not afraid of you. Because I am a member of brave Siegel Knights! 
180608	"I see. It is not the first death, and it will not be the last one either."
180701	Don't be afraid. We will definitely win. 
180702	"We should trust Ermunt and follow him.  Although its end will be death, we, Siegel Knights, are one united body."
180703	"There have been more terrible things than this, but, in the end, we have obtained a victory. Let's trust Ermunt."
180704	"Geder, you have family. Anyone who doesn't want to join this battle may do so. We will surely defeat those chaps from the Empire.."
180705	They are the Imperial Army! Attack!
180706	Siegel Knights never retreat! We will cut you down until the last minute before we leave! 
180707	You shameless fellows from the Empire! I'll revenge my dead colleagues! 
180708	Take this!
180709	I'll dedicate your blood to the graves of my comrades!! 
180711	"That's right, we had been soundly defeated by the Empire. Since then, much time has passed by..."
180712	"You people are not the Imperial Army. My apologies, we are just..."
180802	I feel cold and hungry... I wish the battle would be over soon.
180805	I miss Margarita. and my wife... Are they doing all right there...
180806	I want some cold beer to cool down with.
180807	"Hey, Todd, come over here. I found a strange bug here."
180808	I heard something over there.. Maybe the Imperial soldiers are arriving.
180809	I'd have no regret if I had to die with Ermunt. It's because I owe him my life.
180903	"Now, this forest belongs to us!"
180904	None can pass through the forest!
180905	Get out of our forest!
180906	Take this!
180907	Silly!
180908	Arrgh!
180909	Never think this is the end...
181002	Hmm...I can feel a human coming!
181003	This area is not permitted to you!
181004	Leave here immediately!
181005	You should pay for your negligence.
181006	Go back!
181007	Feel the pain!
181009	You will go through more pain in the ways ahead...
181101	Alarm!
181102	Invader!!
181103	How dare you pass through here!
181104	You will feel only fear and horror!
181105	Hyaa!
181106	Power of Ether!
181107	Arrrgh!
181108	My boss will never stand for your rudeness...
181201	Magic barrier starts to shake!
181203	Die! You will be roaming in the cold sewer forever. 
181204	Give us your life quietly.
181205	Feel the fear!
181206	Suffer!
181207	Don't be pleased...Cold air in underground will make your breath stop...
181208	Curse you....
181301	Who is it!
181302	It is you!
181303	Foolish human!
181305	Feel the power of sealing!
181306	In the name of my lord!
181307	K..ak...ak....
200001	Welcome.
200003	You are always welcome here.
200004	Come back again.
200005	"If you need help, call on me any time."
200006	Don't forget about me.
200021	I don't think anybody knows for sure when this place was created and abandoned.
200022	Gruesome monsters live in there!
200023	Wonder when I will be able to get out of this damned place.
200024	"If you pass by, please come again! It's so boring all by myself."
200025	"If you go to Etherain, please tell the waterworks management to transfer me to another place."
200041	This cursed sewer is filled with Rotten corpses.
200042	I'm sick of corpse smell.
200044	Goodbye. I'd be grateful if you bring me a mask next time you visit.
200045	Sometimes I feel really close to these corpses.
200063	It's great to chat with courageous young people.
200065	We must do something before Etherain is filled with great evil.
200066	We can't give up this land to the Empire.
200101	Through me, you can travel to and from the continent with great ease.
200102	Now is the time for a hero to stand up...and a hero should be where the enemy is.
200103	You must defeat the slaves of the Empire before your vows are diminished.
200104	Greetings.
200105	Welcome.
200107	I can help you.
200108	Please shed some light on this chaotic world.
200109	We need a hero. Please make sure you come again. And take care of yourself.
200201	Valkyrie know best the items for Valkyrie.
200203	We have the best items for Valkyrie.
200204	Any Valkyrie should feel ashamed, associating with Dragonkin.
200205	Dragonkin are rascals who took our land. If the Empire disappears, then it'll be the Dragonkin's turn next.
200211	Go on your way.
200212	The pleasure will be mine, if you leave sooner.
200213	If you encounter any Dragonkin, first of all, give him a punch before you start anything.
200214	If you want to go, go quickly.
200301	Ha ha ha! Ha Ha~
200302	We've got the best ale on the continent.
200303	Burrrrpp...! I wonder who deposited this item.
200304	Welcome. Come on over!
200306	Really nice to meet you!
200307	Goodbye!
200308	See you again next time!
200401	"Hey, there! We got a lot of fine merchandise here. Don't  throw away your opportunity."
200402	Hello, there. Look here, if you're a warrior. I have many items for warriors. 
200405	Whatever.
200406	Welcome.
200408	Come again!
200410	Bye-bye.
200501	We have items for Dragonkin.
200502	The qualities of my items are different from those in other stores.
200503	If you are not a Dragonkin, step away please.
200507	Greetings.
200508	Come again!
200509	I'll stay here until we recover the honor of Dragonkin.
200510	Please come again.
200601	An Elementalist would need items soaked in nature.
200602	Nature is the mightiest power of all.
200605	It's good to see you here.
200608	Tell me what you want.
200609	I think our mission as Elementalists is to reorganize the links of cycle that got out of order.
200610	Take care. See you again next time.
200611	See you later!
200612	May nature protect you.
200613	Go, and use your magical power to help your colleagues.
200701	I...I have good items available.
200702	I...I sell quality items at reasonable prices.
200703	I...I deal in all kinds of items.
200707	Th...thank you.
200708	Thank you.
200709	Goodbye.
200802	I'm not a magician, but the things I offer transcend their power.
200803	I'll craft items in discounted prices only for you! Now, please come here!
200804	I knew you'd come again.
200805	A weapon without power is nothing more than an iron club.
200807	Goodbye!
200808	Um . . . That really is the discounted price. No more discount.
200809	Thank you.
200901	I am busy. I don't have time to chat with you.
200902	Tringel is a small village but has a deep history. 
200903	"Even if you are Liberation Army, I don't think you can protect our village. Do not bother me!"
200904	You look suspicious...
200905	Tringel looks peaceful. But it is always threatened by contaminated tribes in the Forest of Beasts.
200906	"Looking around, it looks so peaceful that it's hard to imagine that hellish fighting is going on just beyond that hill. "
200907	My duty is to look out for activity around the village. Nobody knows what the contaminated creatures in the Forest of Beasts will do. 
200908	Tringel does not belong to Rochel Republic. It is still an autonomous region.
200909	There is a sewer in the Forest of Beasts which connects Tringel to Etherain. It is called the remains of ancient. 
200910	All sorts of Undead are roaming the sewer. Our fate is at least better to fight with living souls than Undead.
200911	You better check your equipment before leaving the village.  Rumor has it that servants of the Empire roam the Forest of Beasts. 
200912	"The Empire is sucking up the vitality of our continent like a leech. If this continues,  Brakion is destined to become a wasteland."
200914	"Magicians in the village can open a 'portal' to the center of the Forest of Beasts and to the Sewer Entrance. If you want go far from the village, go see them."
200915	All sorts of traders are in the village. Most of them came here after the Liberation soldiers gathered. 
200916	A few days ago guards in the Forest of Beasts caught an Empire's spy. I am worried that the Empire will find out the Liberation Army is here.
200917	Tringel may be our first base of operation. But this is more strategic location for our purpose.
200918	I heard it is actually a quiet village where there is little traffic.
200919	"I heard the Empire is plotting something. Be careful not to fall for their trap, please."
200920	"If you want to move to another place fast, you should see the magician who opens a portal to the other village."
200921	It is crowded with merchants and volunteer soldiers.
200922	"Now, it is the base for the Liberation Army but it was originally the base for Valkyrie and Shadow."
200923	"I heard a spy of the Empire has been around our town lately. If you see any suspicious strangers, let me know."
200926	"If you want to have better equipment, you should go see merchants who have same job as you do."
200927	"Most of the merchants here cannot fight anymore for various reasons. But, they gathered here to contribute to the Liberation Army."
200928	Nobody could have known what coould happen in the world. Who knew that so many people would come to gather at the end of East land.
200929	I am an aborigine here. I take pride in protecting this place.
200930	"Sometimes, people are confused that this is Rochel's land. But it is undeniably an autonomous area just like Tringel."
200931	I am concerned about advance troops who went into Rochel Republic. My brother is a part of those troops.
200932	"A long time ago, trees or animals with special powers lived together with humans."
200933	We have lost many things because of the Ether Plant of the Empire. Too many mystical animals and trees which coexisted with us have disappeared.
200934	The Emperor must be crazy. It is most tragic that such a crazy person has the most power.
200935	"As a man, I will make a wonderful life. I will volunteer to join the Liberation Army. I will have great success in my life someday."
200936	"Z-Z-Z, Oops, I wasn't sleeping. I..I was just thinking about something."
200938	Etherain means the hope of Rochel. This place was founded by Altheim and Roshfelt migrants who were defeated by the Empire.
200939	Our Etherain! How beautiful it is! Feel free to look around.
200940	"Contaminated dark Ether from the Ether Plant is killing our land. However, the scholars have found a substitute material."
200941	The end of the Empire is near. I will give full support to you and the Liberation Army.
200942	Well..many people are still not sure whether it was a good idea to accept the Liberation Army.
200943	"The Empire will punish us soon. Actually, it is unusual that the Empire has not done anything yet."
200944	Our ancestors resisted the Empire to the end. Anyone against the Empire is our brother or sister.
200945	I still cannot believe it. How could our leader do that...
200946	"Hmm...if too many wanderers come in, it will be a mess. Oh, I don't mean you."
200947	My girlfriend is mad because I said the leader of the Liberation Army is a strikingly beautiful woman. I don't understand her! I just told the truth.
200948	I am the descendant of a migrant from the Altheim Kingdom. I heard the last princess of Altheim had unsurpassed beauty.
200949	"People say the Emperor is immortal but I don't believe that. Someday, the Emperor will fall with the Empire."
200950	"Altheim and Roshfelt have fought in the past. Perhaps, our ancestors never imagined  that Altheim and Roshfelt would unite."
200951	"I guess this place will become more dangerous. Since the Empire knows we found a way to oppose the Ether Plant, they will not let us be."
200952	History of the land will change significantly no matter who wins. I am just proud of the fact that I am part of history.
200954	"There are magicians here to provide transfer service to other areas, as well. Of course, their fee is quiet expensive."
200957	"I pray this village, which means Rochel's hope, will be the hope of the entire Brakion Continent someday."
200959	"z-z-z...No... Nothing to report!  Aha, you startled me!"
200960	"I am on special alert duty. If you have any questions, ask other people."
200961	Most merchants are senior members of this village. You better not do anything to get on their bad side.
200962	The Empire takes not only Ether but also our future from us.
200964	Our leader's action was against the every founding spirit of our nation. I will never forgive him.
201001	Don't..Don't hit me!
201002	"I am the servant of the Dragon Sorcerer, Hillarus. If you hit me, my master will retaliate!"
201003	"Don't hit me! I'll show you the things! However, my master said that don't sell any thing if there are no twinkling things!"
201004	Give me twinkling thing! and then nice Cormit will show master Hillarius's things.
201005	"My colleagues are absolutely crazy! But, Cormit is not crazy! That's why he is caught!"
201006	If you show twinkling things~! Show the things~! My master told me!
201007	I am going back. I am going back to master Hillarus.
201008	"Hi!!.  Cormit is well mannered, indeed."
201009	"Crazy colleagues killed all of our tribe! However, Cormit is alive!"
201021	This is a never ending maze!
201022	All my colleagues have disappeared.
201023	I'm just waiting for the next group.
201024	"If you meet them, please let them know that I'm here!"
201025	I hope that you come with some friends next time.
201026	I hate being alone.
201041	I don't know when this place became a nest for the undead.
201042	It's a never ending corpsefest.
201043	Nobody will believe me when I tell them what I saw here.
201044	I don't know how long I will have to scout this place.
201045	"The resistance needs to know at once, the serious condition that the sewer is in."
201046	Please let the resistance know about this place.
201063	I feel like going on a picnic.
201064	"Goodbye, friend!"
201065	Let's have a drink together sometime.
201066	Let's live until the day that we are victorious.
201102	My colleagues have been caught. Please help!
201103	"This is a dead-end cave. It has a way in, but there is no way out. The Iron Tribe took advantage of the Empire's power to block their base with magic. I think the Magic Seal can be broken by a special lever, but I don't have any idea where it's located."
201104	The Iron Tribe is very good at surprise attack. Watch your step as they can come out from anywhere.
201105	I've seen Ether sorcerers who have been dealing with the Iron Tribe. Most of them are Demons from the Empire. Ether sorcerers may still be somewhere in this den.
201203	"I'm Uline, a patroller of Tringel. I've been monitoring the Iron Tribe here."
201204	"The Iron Tribe came to have a mighty power with the help of the Empire. Pillars over there show the fact. Those pillars devour the sound ether of the woods and produce black ether instead. If we don't destroy them, the Iron Tribe will get stronger and someday they will try to conquer the village."
201205	"It seems that some pillars can be operated and other pillars cannot. And if you touch a pillar, the Iron Tribesmen will take notice and come to get you. So, be careful."
201206	"I think I saw one ether pillar to the right of that forked road and another one at the outside of the vacant lot down the hill. Although I only saw a few, there may be more."
201207	"I will stay here until all of my colleagues get out of this cave. You root up the ether pillars spread in the woods. Without them, the contaminated ones in the Beast Forest will disappear before long."
201301	"An evil Sorcerer has awaken us from the death. If her seal is not removed, we can't sleep in eternity and you can't go forward."
201302	My comrades had awakened from their rest to repeat the last battle with the Empire. You're just the Imperial Army to them. Please release my comrades from their terrible nightmare.
201303	There are five seals of the Sorcerer. Four of them are here. Please break them so that we can rest again. Eternal death is what we hope for.
201304	"The seal is protected by an evil power, and strange mechanical devices are attached to it. You'd better be prepared before you get closer to it."
201401	Hmm...I feel the wind blowing through this gap.
201403	"Well, the feel of money is still good even in such times. It's a pity I cannot spend it all before dying."
201407	"I hope to meet you again, alive."
201408	See you at the next battle.
201501	[A skeleton gazes upon you with an empty eye and raises its bony hand to point at a dark cave.]
201601	"Many of the living have passed by here. However, their faith was either being defeated by the Sword of Veron or killed by the leader."
201603	"Memory is fading day by day. Now a magic seal of soul is the only thing left.  You've come a long way, and you're the only hope we have. Go underground."
201604	"Please handle the evil trap of the Sorcerer, and kill the captain within the deep ruins. He probably wants it too."
201701	"What a surprise, you finally come here. Many of my comrads died in these ruins. If we are surrounded by them, your future and our hope will be gone."
201702	"You should find a way to defeat my fellows one by one, noble mind! You are only the Imperial Army to their eyes. "
201703	Your bravery and strength reminds me of Ermunt in the past. I believe you are enough to defeat the Empire even though we failed...
201704	Songs surrounding us are the same as the brilliance that surrounds you. Go! Go and make us sleep in the brilliance forever. 
201802	The dark force is growing faster and faster. Something must be done. 
201803	"Nice to see you. You are the rumoured Rebel Army. Just look around, the dark force is growing faster and faster around the village."
201805	"This is the path to Etherain. It was really a beautiful forest. However, it has become a dreadful and fearful forest full of awful traps."
201904	"This forest is cursed! If you touch anything, even a tree, horrible monsters will come out and kill you!"
201905	"I should have not left. There is a job in Etherain, but I will never leave this forest and those monsters."
202002	"Well...I don't know if it is better to sell materials at low prices, even to monsters..."
202003	"I know it is dangerous place. But, the reward of success will increase as the risk increases!"
202005	"A long time ago, many people used to pass through here but only refugees are here nowadays. It is probably because of the Empire soldiers scattered all over the place."
202021	Welcome.
202024	Goodbye.
202025	"If we are both alive, we will see each other again sometime."
202026	We will someday attain real freedom.
202041	We should never let down our guard.
202042	We must always be on alert during war times.
202043	"This place is dangerous, so you must be careful."
202044	May luck be with you.
202045	I hope to see you in good health next time.
202046	Don't let down your guard.
202103	Oh...Finally we made it here! It's so wonderful! This is the end of the forest. However... nobody returns alive once they go into that cave. 
202105	"You have passed through that forest and may feel like a hero, but you must turn back. I have never seen anyone return alive from the cave in front. It is a pity... they were all outstanding soldiers..."
202202	Please...sa...save my life.
202203	"In front, there is their chief.  Be careful of him!"
202204	"It, It is not a creature of this forest! Those are monsters created by the Empire! You must stay alive and tell this to my chief..."
202301	Hi. Good to see you!
202303	I feel heavy and stiff. It is probably because I haven't been in battle for a long time.
202304	"Whenever you need help, look for the mercenary guild."
202305	Repairing Axes and Swords is like the life of a Berserker.
202401	I will never understand the human.
202402	I should spread the honorable name of the Dragonkin once again.
202403	I can't believe it. There are so many rude people.
202404	You should feel proud to have talked with a Dragon.
202405	A Dragon's existence is one that knows honor and pride.
202502	Humans seem to be lovely and curious creatures.
202503	I wish my brother had more understanding of humans.
202504	Come back anytime if you need my help.
202505	May the honor of Dragon be with you.
202506	I hope to meet you later.
202601	Nice to see you.
202602	All of us should truly understand nature and soul. 
202603	Valkyrie are so proud of being with the great nature.
202604	May the great nature bless you.
202606	Remember our duty to protect nature from Ether.
202702	"Hello, magic is the power to make everything come true."
202703	I believe magic has the power to protect many people.
202704	"Good-bye, I hope to see you again."
202705	"To harness the power of Mana, you should constantly train your mind. "
202706	Ether is false power like deception. You should get rid of it.
203002	A real warrior does not spare a single penny when it comes to increasing weapon performance.
203004	It's hard to find such a skilled enhancement merchant in this town.
203006	Show me the item.
203007	I hope that you are satisfied.
203008	Goodbye.
203009	Come back again.
204001	I have everything except for things I don't have.
204002	I will get and sell anything you want!
204003	"Come, come."
204005	You must have great eyes for things to have come to our store.
204007	Goodbye.
204008	Come back anytime!
204009	Have a good journey!
204101	This is Anton's general store!
204102	Take a look at my items.
204103	It's good weather. Come and see my items.
204104	Hi. It's nice weather today.
204105	Nice to see you.
204106	Our store only carries the best items.
204107	Don't forget Anton!
204108	See you again next time!
204109	"If you need anything, come see me at anytime."
204201	I'm tired of plain Potions.
204202	I need to make some new Potions.
204203	Something special! I need something special.
204204	Endless research is the only path to creation.
204205	People will never be satisfied with plain Potions from now on.
204206	I think merchants need to make new items.
204207	"Someday, I will make a surprising invention."
204208	Come back some time. I will have made something really cool by then.
204209	Goodbye.
204301	Welcome to Etherain.
204302	Etherain is our hope.
204303	Please rest here.
204304	For the liberation of mankind.
204305	Good luck with your future endeavours.
204306	Etherain is always safe.
204401	It's nice to meet you.
204402	Hello.
204403	I am on duty.
204404	Bye.
204405	I'm sorry that I was too busy to help you.
204406	Take care.
204501	Beasts are behaving strangely.
204503	Hello. I'm Guard Captain Heinrich.
204504	Please travel with care.
204505	Beware of attacks by beasts.
204506	Have a nice trip.
204601	Greetings.
204604	Travel always requires extra attention.
204605	Feel free to visit me anytime if you need any assistance.
204606	Please be extra careful.
204701	Hello!
204702	What fine weather!
204704	Be on your way!
204705	"Next time, bring something!"
204706	Hi! Hi!
250001	Hello.
250002	Welcome!
250004	Take care.
250005	Goodbye.
250006	See you again!
250064	Bye!
250065	"Take care, young man."
250066	"We will meet again if we are alive, hehe."
250071	Hello.
250072	"If you have something to say, make it brief."
250073	I can spare a moment to hear what you have to say.
250074	Goodbye.
250075	"Don't disturb me, unless you have business of some importance."
250076	Leave if you're done.
250081	"Good to see you, young Guidance."
250083	Hello.
250084	Goodbye.
250085	May luck be with you for the rest of your journey.
250086	Please come again anytime you feel the need.
250101	Hello.
250102	Welcome!
250104	Take care.
250105	Goodbye.
250106	See you again!
250111	Welcome.
250113	Nice to see you.
250114	God bless the path before you.
250115	See you around.
250116	Please take care.

350005	I really hope you'll be okay!
350006	Please come and see me whenever you need my help.
350101	"Now, it is time to strengthen power by ourselves."
350102	It's nice to meet you.
350104	Learn how to protect yourself. 
350105	For the freedom of Humans. 
350106	"If you have any difficulty, do not hesitate to call on me."
350203	Hello.
350204	Leave the security of Tringel in our hands for it will be safe with us.
350205	Always be cautious around the Imperial Army.
350206	The way to protect us is to keep watch and ward.
350304	"These days, the Imperial Army is on alert. Be careful!"
350305	Good bye.
350306	"Next time you come, I hope you'll send me a message in advance."
350401	Waldchen and Tringel are historic villages that have existed for a long time.

350404	I hope you'll come to the library anytime you want to learn more about our predecessors.
350405	I'm always happy to talk to a youngster.
350406	"Good bye, my friend. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to come back. "
350501	Hi. Good to see you!

350603	I can't believe it. There are so many rude people.
350604	You should feel proud to have talked with a Dragon.
350605	A Dragon's existence is one that knows honor and pride.
350606	Remember the pride of a Dragon Knight.
350702	Humans seem to be lovely and curious creatures.
350703	I wish my brother had more understanding of humans.

200121	We need to destroy the device which summons the Imperial Army's troops.  Until then, their numbers will never decrease.
200122	The Imperial Army's camp is usually located on a strategically important hilltop. There seem to be many soldiers there, which likely means that they are preparing for war.
200123	The Imperial Army has moved north and control the path to the Snowy Plains. While Etherain's Sorcerers have made a device to bypass the Empire's blockade, the Empire has found and destroyed the device.
200124	The only route to the Frozen Palace is through the Snowy Plainss, but that was blocked by the Empire's Army long ago. If you need to get to the Frozen Palace, you must use the temporary portal created by Etherain's Sorcerers.
200125	The Imperial Army has been conquered at the Western Tower. If you can make it from there to the Frozen Palace alive, that feat alone will make you a hero.
200126	These people don't look normal, so be careful -- nobody will be able to find your corpse to bury you if you die here.
200127	I agree with the General's opinion that we need to strike at the Imperial Army first, before they attack us. I hope you come back safely after completing your mission.
200129	The Life Seal is an extremely vicious curse. It provides protection by trapping others' souls. It's pitiful to see how desperate the Empire is to protect their magic.
200130	Recently, I spotted an iron-clad wolf near the water who looked somewhat different from the Empire's wolves. Maybe it's true that a pack of these escaped wolves live somewhere out there.
200131	The Imperial Army's Snowy Plains troops are very skilled in camouflage.  Be careful, as they will suddenly appear out of nowhere and attack!
200132	The Imperial Army's Snowy Plains troops have moved threateningly close to Etherain, so we must save Etherain's citizens as soon as possible.
200133	We cannot protect you once you are on the other side of the castle walls. Please be careful!
200134	We wish you to complete your task and return safely. The Rebel Army will be victorious when the city is safe.
200135	Anyhow, I believe the Rebel Army will save us from the Empire, so please take care of yourself.
200139	Although I'm happy that the corrupt officials were killed off from Etherain, now that I think about it, life was easier back when we didn't have to fight off the Imperial Army.
200140	If you die outside the castle, nobody will be able to get past the Imperial Army to retrieve your corpse. You'd better be careful.
200141	I don't like the Rebel Army making secret plans. I don't have any reason to believe in secret groups.
200142	Go away! Whatever you do, just go away! All of this nonsense happened because of you and your Rebel Army. You had better finish this off and complete your plans, otherwise the Empire will come back with an even stronger vengeance!
200143	Those Rebel Army forces that ventured outside the castle were never returned. Such a pity! Don't frown, though. If you don't want my pity, just make sure you come back alive.
200144	I heard rumors that you're going to the Snowy Plains. Of course you already know that to get there, you'll need to activate the portal made by Etherain's Sorcerers.
200145	The device is located in front of the transfer towers on each path. You can find them on your map. I've heard the western tower near the Frozen Palace is protected by our soldiers, if they're still alive.
200146	If you go outside the castle gates, go to the western tower and look for Guard Captain Ernst. If the general is still alive, he will help you. 
200147	Many Rebel Army officers have passed through the castle gates in order to receive their orders. None of them received orders to save the survivors in the tower, however. Huh! Of course! No wonder so few have returned to the castle.
200149	While the tower was being attacked, the authorities stood idly by even though they were warned of the attack. They did request the assistance of the Rebel Army, however. I'm ashamed of myself because I had to follow my superior's orders and wait for the Rebel Army while the tower was under siege.
200150	Sigh. Go away! Try working on your honor, then you will realize that you are a pawn on a much larger chessboard.
200151	Captain Ernst is not someone you can just desert to die like this. I will never forgive the authorities for the decisions they made. Now go away! That is all I have to say to you!
200165	I'd rather be under Ernst's protection than to go out there with you. If you make it to the city, tell them there are survivors here. I'm sure they don't care, though.
200166	Come back again anytime! Before I die, preferably.
200167	Be careful! Not too careful, though -- the more Empire soldiers you kill, the better the chance we'll make it out of here.
200172	The Imperial Army has blocked every path to the Snowy Plains. You will use the transport device, but with so many Empire troops around, it will still be difficult.
201122	The Imperial Army came from the Snowy Plains. They encircled and camped outside Etherain, isolating us and threatening to do something drastic.
201123	The worst scenario would be if Schutzwaltz's Northern forces joined up with the Imperial Army's Western forces. If they attacked Etherain together, Etherain could not hold for more than one week.
201124	The city is buzzing with talk about the war outside. Whether you decide to attack or defend, remember that your primary duty is to protect Etherain from harm.
201126	Long ago, before the Snowy Plains was iced over, it could have been called the Land of Angels. It was a beautiful place until the Schutzwalt family moved into the castle.
201127	Erihi Schutzwalt was trying to save her daughter, Cecily. They say you can still hear Erihi's voice desperately calling her daughter's name.
201129	Etherain's political system is extremely corrupt, but with war on the horizon, the citizens are happier with the way things are than with the prospect of more Rebel soldiers inviting conflict inside the walls.
201130	Be careful. Once you leave the walls of the castle, you are no longer protected by our soldiers.
201131	I hope you complete your mission and return soon. Etherain's safety depends on the success of the Rebellion.
201135	We never though the peaceful Snowflower Tribe would attack our castle walls! I think the Empire coerced them into doing this.
201136	Elementalist of Snowflower Tree Tribe can summon a Ice Spirit.  But they are limited as to how many they can summon.
201137	The Empire's Captain Haman stands in front of the castle door. We suspect he is commanding the Snowflower Tribe's efforts to attack us.
201138	The Snowflower Tribe doesn't have enough resources on its own to attack Etherain, so they must be getting help.
201139	I'm sick and tired of fighting the reptile tribes and their annoying hissing!
201140	Look at how the Snowflower Tribe broke down this wall. I wonder why they didn't continue with their attack and spill through the wall! Very curious indeed.
201141	I was shocked that the reptilian tribes could use their own official language. So much incomprehensible hissing all night long, I would drive me crazy!
201142	I wish we didn't have to fight against that reptilian tribe. It turns out they are decent fighters.
201145	The Snowflower Tribe was never known to attack a human before the Empire showed up. Now, though, the land is filled with spite and injustice.
201151	I'm busy right now. Talk to the captain if you need anything.
201152	Leave me alone -- you don't know what it's like to spend the night surrounded by enemies.
201154	We're guarding the teleporter, yes, but we're trapped here and Etherain seems to have abandoned us without sending reinforcements.
201155	We're surrounded by the Empire's forces, so Etherain can't possibly be telling the truth when they say they'll rescue us. You Rebels are all the same.
201156	We all have family and friends, but our superiors in Etherain seem to have forgotten this about us.
201158	We're the only ones left here now, but we were able to protect the castle so far.
201159	A merchant saw the Sorcerers get attacked as they were installing the teleporter. About 20 Sorcerers tried fighting back the Empire's soldiers, but to no avail.
201160	The Empire has a strange device that can summon limitless numbers of soldiers. That is why so many of our troops have been killed, and if we didn't have such a strong captain, I would have suffered the same fate long ago.
201162	Without our captain, we would be dead by now. I don't want to imagine what would happen if anything happened to him.
201163	The Empire's soldiers are scared of our captain, too. The other tower's soldiers were probably not so lucky, though.
201165	Our brothers in arms are exhausted and have little morale. They're convinced that reinforcements won't come, even if the request made it to Etherain. The government there doesn't care about its soldiers. This time they'll pay the consequences for their neglect.
201167	How brave and strong Ernst might be, he will fall soon. I've heard that the Empire's Sorcerers will make an offering to Helron. If Ernst falls, he will undergo the same fate as Otto, becoming their sacrificial guinea pig.
201171	Our soldiers defend the road to the Snowy Plains but the entrance has long been blocked by the Emprire's magic. The only escape from here is to run the transport device of Etherain sorcerers again.
201172	The transporter is located at the crossroads. Two of the three transporters fell into the Empire's hands, as our soldiers were no match for the Empire's throngs.
201173	Unfortunately, the transporter has been sealed by a curse the Empire. In order to break the seal, you must first kill whoever cast the spell.
201174	Don't lose hope. Remember that the Empire's camps are always established on hilltops, while the transporters are found at lower-lying crossroads in front of a tower.
201175	It's vital that we understand the Empire's tactics. We can use them to predict their future movements. Happy boxing!
201176	If you succeed in your mission, we can open the road to Etherain. Please do this quickly, as I cannot stand to see my brothers continue to die.
201177	Be on your way to complete your mission. I will stay with my soldiers here to fight and protect the tower. We will meet again if we are successful.

202052	Defense here is very tight because it is used to connetecd the Snowy Plains and the volcano.
202053	Since the command of the Imperial Army's migration, troublesome events are occurring everywhere.
202054	Don't worry, though, you are safe in Etherain.
202055	We will take care of your safety, so plase take rest.
202056	I wish you safe travel.
203051	Loyalty!
203052	So far, I have not encountered anything strange.
203053	Right now I am on duty so please talk to me later.  
203054	Don't bother me while I'm working!
203055	Bye.
203056	Have a pleasant time.
204051	The waters of Crystal Lake are extremely cold.
204052	The monsters have been trying to take over all the lakes and water sources around here.
204053	There have been many more of these monsters' camps around here.
204054	Always be on your guard.
204055	Return to Etherain as soon as possible.
204056	Be careful - the monsters only get more powerful as you make your way forward.
204061	The weather is getting much colder.
204062	The lake's water is so cold, your teeth ache if you drink it.
204063	We need to rotate the castle guards as soon as possible.
204064	The weather is quite cold -- be careful not to catch a frostbite!
204065	You'll need to dress warmly.
204066	I hope to see you again!
204031	This place is too cold.
204032	I'm sick of these monsters.
204034	Goodbye.
204036	Next time, bring me a hard, stiff drink.
204012	Beginners don't last long around here.
204013	(Stares up and down unpleasantly, and sighs)
204014	Hurry on back to Etherain!
204015	This is not an easy place.
204016	Always watch your back.
203011	This is not a place where you can relax.
203013	This place is dangerous since the enemy could attack at any time.
203014	I hope you value your life.
203015	I'm always here to protect this place.
203016	I'm not going to let them capture the Wolf Rock Guard Post!
202011	Welcome to the Snowy Plains Outpost.
202012	This is where we track the movements of the Imperial Army in the Snowy Plains.
202013	Welcome!
202014	Take care of yourself.
202015	Come back anytime if you find it difficult out in the Snowy Plains.
202016	Sometimes the cold can be harsher than the Imperial Army, so please be careful.
201011	Yes, this is the Snowy Plains Outpost.
201014	Goodbye and make sure you stay awake!
201016	Next time, bring some warm fur boots for us.
200011	I enjoy the cold weather.
200012	I enjoy working here.
200013	The volcano seems to be quite active!
200014	Goodbye! I hope you find the snow beautiful too!
200015	Enjoy the brilliance of the Snowy Plains!

170111	Curse you!!
170112	You'll feel the fear of a kind you've never felt before.
170113	Don't think it's over because you've beaten me . . . .
170114	You did better than I thought. You've come a long way...
170115	You will regret that you came here!
170116	You'd . . . better . . . go . . . .

203178	"We're the Liberation Army. We're the ones who have gathered around Ignis for the liberation of humans. What we're up against is the Imperial Army led by the King of Immortality, Schwartz. He was once a human like us, but somehow gained the power of evil and has become the King of Immortality. But what is more important, is that he has become something that can't stop destroying things even if he wanted to. Well, or now we need to focus on defending ourselves. And it would be even better if we could drive off the Imperial Army and restore the glories of our past."

203199	"Welcome to the Liberation Army. I've been waiting here for someone like you to arrive. I don't know what trials and destiny your future holds. What is certain however, is that the war against the King of Immortality, Schwartz, and his Imperial Army, is unavoidable. They're already watching you. That is, they suspect you may one day become a great threat to them. But, they've already made a huge mistake -  they've only been watching you, and haven't done anything else. If I were Schwartz, I'd have gone for your life first. As it is, you offer us great strength. Please show us hope as well!"
